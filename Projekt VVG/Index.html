        <p>
          The assembly line is where Ferrari is truly born, a swift and
          complicated dance between robotics and the human hand, both working in
          minute detail to produce the perfect finished article - the latest
          Prancing Horse to roll out of the factory.
        </p>
        <p>
          A range of freshly painted vehicle chassis arrive at the first stage
          of the assembly line each day - and more than half of them will be in
          completely different palettes with clients able to choose from around
          2 million colour combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial stages of the line are completely automated as machines
          lift the chassis into position using huge ‘C-hooks’. At this point the
          cars are essentially separated into top and bottom. The bottom will be
          fitted with the powertrain coming from the engine assembly line, the
          top is fitted with electrics too and then the top is married to the
          bottom section.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is a well-drilled and deeply careful series of stages,
          from fitting important exterior details like the famous Scudetto
          emblem to installing the heavy, leather-clad dashboards; a difficult
          task requiring a specialised robot to be guided by hand into the small
          cabin space, placing the dash carefully without damaging the interior.
        </p>
        <p>
          At most stages on the assembly line, each highly-skilled technician
          ensures all the screws and fastenings are tightened and quality
          checked before moving on to the next vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology-packed steering wheels and seats are carefully put into
          place by the technicians with special tools to ensure correct fit, the
          exterior of the car is worked on, with bumpers being fixed on around
          sensors and headlights positioned on the front and rear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, amid the rhythmic sounds of sewing machines, experienced
          workers are taking huge strips of leather, marking it up to note any
          imperfections, then transferring it to a cutting machine to ensure
          only the finest parts are used for the car’s upholstery.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the line, the finished vehicle rolls majestically away,
          ready to be taken for extensive testing and quality control. And then,
          the next day, more unfinished cars arrive and the dance begins again…

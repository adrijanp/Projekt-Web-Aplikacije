          NUMBER 50 AND 51 FERRARI 499P DRIVERS CONFIRMED FOR FIA WEC 2024
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Ferrari - AF Corse team is set to participate in the FIA WEC 2024,
          fielding the 499Ps with the same drivers who played key roles in the
          previous world championship season. Antonio Fuoco, Miguel Molina and
          Nicklas Nielsen will share the number 50 car, while Alessandro Pier
          Guidi, James Calado and Antonio Giovinazzi will start in the number
          51.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ferrari has officially confirmed the crews that contributed to
          securing runner-up spot in the Manufacturers' championship in the 2023
          debut season in the top class of the FIA World Endurance Championship.
          The Hypercar with the number 50 on the livery will be raced by the
          trio that last year achieved four podiums – in Sebring, Portimão,
          Monza and Bahrain – and two pole positions, in America and Le Mans,
          results that earned Fuoco-Molina-Nielsen the third step of the podium
          in the Drivers' standings, ahead of their teammates. The number 51
          "sister" car, winner at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and on the podium at
          Spa-Francorchamps, will be driven by Pier Guidi-Calado-Giovinazzi.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coletta, Global Head of Endurance and Corse Clienti</strong>:
          “The choice to retain the drivers who competed last year with the
          499Ps for the Ferrari - AF Corse team in the 2024 FIA WEC season
          reflects a commitment to continuity. In 2023, with these crews
          undertaking their maiden outing in the top class of the world
          championship, we accomplished remarkable results including a victory
          at Le Mans and six podium finishes out of seven races. These
          achievements allowed us to secure an excellent runner-up spot in the
          Constructors' championship by the end of the year. Together we have
          gained experience as we continue to develop our car and demonstrate
          its potential. Building upon these foundations, we look forward to the
          now imminent 2024 season with optimism, renewing our confidence in our
          drivers.”

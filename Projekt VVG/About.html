          Ferrari, founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari, is an iconic Italian luxury
          sports car manufacturer known for its passion for racing and producing
          some of the world's most exclusive and high-performance vehicles. The
          distinctive prancing horse logo and signature red color have become
          synonymous with elegance, speed, and a rich automotive heritage. With
          a strong racing heritage in Formula One, Ferrari has consistently
          pushed the boundaries of automotive engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brand's dedication to crafting luxurious sports cars, adorned with
          the iconic prancing horse emblem, has made it a symbol of style,
          performance, and unparalleled craftsmanship. Ferrari's relentless
          pursuit of excellence has earned it a special place in the hearts of
          automotive enthusiasts worldwide.

        <p>
          The company currently offers a large model range which includes
          several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris,
          dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars
          ever sold at auction. Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast
          culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was labelled
          the world's strongest brand by the financial consultency Brand
          Finance. As of May 2023 Ferrari is also one of the largest car
          manufacturers by market capitalisation, with a value of approximately
          US$52 billion.

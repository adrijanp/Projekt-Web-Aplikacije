        <h3>FERRARI PUROSANGUE: GRAND TOUR OF NEW ZEALAND CONCLUDES</h3>
        <p>
          The Ferrari New Zealand Grand Tour, which saw the Maranello marque
          embark on a voyage of rediscovery of the spectacular Southern
          Hemisphere islands between late November and early December, has now
          come to a successful conclusion. Five Ferrari Purosangues each covered
          3000 km over three weeks as they explored New Zealand’s extraordinary
          natural landscapes, scenic mountain roads and culture-rich cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Purosangue was chosen for this ground-breaking tour because it
          represents a new standard in the automotive industry, thanks to its
          innovative take on the modern, high-riding, four-door GT car. Many
          Ferraris have made combining benchmark performance with first-class
          comfort one of the pillars of their success, but the Purosangue takes
          that to a new level. With its 725 cv, mid-front-mounted V12 it truly
          brings together the best in terms of driving thrills, comfort and
          refinement - courtesy of its spacious and luxurious four-seat interior
          - and sports car handling thanks to its world-first active suspension
          system and uncompromising transaxle layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour gave 50 international journalists a first-hand experience of
          the Ferrari Purosangue’s prowess as they shared duties behind the
          wheel on different legs of a route that criss-crossed the two islands,
          leaving the motorways surrounding Auckland behind on the way to the
          spectacularly dynamic roads of the Southern Alps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having left Auckland, which is both the country’s financial capital -
          and its largest city with a population of over 1.5 million - the group
          first headed for the golden sands of Waihi Beach before moving on to
          Tuaranga to explore iconic Mount Maunganaui, an extinct volcano sacred
          to the Maori people that dominates the shores of the Bay of Plenty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second day of the tour saw the convoy of cars reach Rotorua, home
          to one of the world’s most active geothermal fields. There, they
          discovered Maori culture and the huge variety of local fauna,
          including the iconic Kiwi, New Zealand’s symbol. The group then
          continued on towards beautiful Taupo, an area of green hills with
          magnificently dramatic views of the lake of the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day, the group headed for the coastal town of Hastings where
          they visited the Whakarewarewa Forest Park and admired its imposing
          trees. In heavy rain, they also traversed the iconic Gentle Annie
          road, which winds through the inland hills of the North Island. A
          tough challenge that the Purosangue lapped up with absolute ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth leg of the Tour saw the group driving to Wellington, New
          Zealand’s capital, through the stunning vineyards of the famous
          Martinborough wine-growing region. The visit to Wellington also
          provided the perfect opportunity to tour the workshop that has
          produced sets and costumes for some of the most famous and
          award-winning fantasy and science fiction films ever made, many of
          which were also set in the archipelago’s extraordinary natural
          landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cars were then transported by ferry to the South Island where the
          tour set out again from the little town of Blenheim to explore one of
          the world’s most renowned wine-growing areas, Marlborough. Once they
          got to the coastal city of Kaikoura, the participants were treated to
          an aerial view of the wonderful marine life of the South Pacific
          Ocean, including whales and dolphins aplenty. A special and unexpected
          evening meeting with a 166 Inter from 1948, the fourth road car ever
          produced, proved a very moving occasion and served as a timely
          reminder of the Prancing Horse’s unparalleled ability to create a
          sense of belonging and emotional impact amongst its enthusiasts,
          something it has done for over 76 years.

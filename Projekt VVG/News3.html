        <h3>MORROW CROWNS BRILLIANT SEASON WITH TITLE WIN</h3>
        <p>
          Andrew Morrow celebrated the British title of the Ferrari Challenge
          Trofeo Pirelli at the end of a thrilling race on European soil at the
          iconic Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which hosted the final round in
          September 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finishing second under the chequered flag in the final race of the
          season meant Morrow clinched the British title in his first full
          season in the Prancing Horse's one-make series.
          <i>“It couldn't have gone any better,”</i> commented the newly crowned
          champion at the end of the event at the historic circuit in the
          Ardennes forest,
          <i
            >“because before the start of the last race, we honestly did not
            know if the championship was still within our grasp. I am delighted
            with the result.”</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          For the young Northern Irishman, it is a win that was born a year and
          a half ago when, after obtaining his racing licence, Morrow got behind
          the wheel of the Ferrari 488 Challenge Evo in the British series,
          achieving a victory in 2022 at the second race held at the Snetterton
          circuit. Since then, his journey has been marked by a steady
          improvement, which has seen the Charles Hurst driver climb the top
          step of the podium three times in the 2023 races. Among these, he
          secured the “Grand Slam” at the inaugural round at Snetterton – pole
          position, fastest lap and victory, leading from start to finish over
          the course of a single weekend – a prestigious result that Morrow
          delivered in both Race-1 and Race-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Morrow, it was the best possible start to a 2023 season that has
          seen him climbing the podium no fewer than 10 times, finishing every
          race in the top-3.
          <i
            >“The Ferrari 488 Challenge Evo is a fantastic car and the Ferrari
            Challenge UK is a great big family,”</i
          >
          says Morrow, hailing his triumphant season.

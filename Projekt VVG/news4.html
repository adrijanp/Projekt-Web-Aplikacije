        <h3>THE 2023 OF #50 499P, AS TOLD BY FUOCO, MOLINA AND NIELSEN</h3>
        <p>
          The Ferrari 499P number 50’s calling card was a pole position in its
          FIA WEC debut, clocking the fastest qualifying time in round one at
          Sebring. Antonio Fuoco, Miguel Molina, and Nicklas Nielsen repeated
          this result at Le Mans, taking the Hyperpole. These results, along
          with the four season podiums, gave the crew third place in the
          standings of the Drivers’ championship and contributed to Ferrari’s
          runner-up spot in the Manufacturers’ championship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >“Sebring and Le Mans will always be two special weekends for
            me,”</i
          >
          said Fuoco, whose qualifying laps earned him first place on the grid
          in the USA and France.
          <i
            >“In America, we showed up with a Ferrari prototype after half a
            century. There were many unknowns because we faced competitors for
            the first time, and starting first in the race was a good way to
            kick off. All the spotlights were on us at Le Mans. When I stepped
            out of the 499P with pole position in my ‘pocket’, I was really
            elated.”</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The driver, whose sporting education took place at the Ferrari Driver
          Academy, managed to extract the full potential of the Prancing Horse
          Hypercar. What was the secret?
          <i
            >“I admit the ‘hot’ lap has never been my strong point, but this
            year we worked hard on every aspect of qualifying, and I improved a
            lot, as I did in race pace,”</i
          >
          explained the 27-year-old driver.
          <i
            >“2024? Considering the increased number of Hypercars, it will be an
            even more complex season, so starting from the front could prove
            even more decisive.”</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Competing in endurance is an exercise entailing not only a quest for
          the best performance but also excellent interaction with teammates, as
          Molina pointed out:
          <i
            >“The concept of teamwork is essential. With Antonio, we had already
            gained experience in 2022, finishing the year in the FIA WEC with a
            victory in Bahrain in the Ferrari 488 GTE. So this year, it was a
            matter of continuing a path already embarked upon and improving it
            further.”</i
          >
          The 34-year-old Spanish driver added:
          <i
            >“However, I was just starting with Nicklas, and we immediately
            struck up an excellent understanding. The balance within the crew,
            for both the 499P number 50 and the 51, is an essential key enabling
            us to express the car’s potential.”</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          For Nielsen, the red ‘tide’ under the podium at Monza was one of the
          most exciting images of the year when, in midsummer, the drivers of
          the 499P number 50 finished second in the fifth round of the season.
          <i
            >“We felt the warmth of the 65,000 spectators in the stands, many of
            whom, kitted out in red, waved flags with the Prancing Horse
            emblazoned on them,”</i
          >
          recalled the 26-year-old Dane.
          <i
            >“It was a great joy to race a Ferrari on the most famous and
            historic Italian circuit and witness that final track invasion.”</i
          >
